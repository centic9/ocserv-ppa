Using Radius with ocserv
========================

For radius support the [radcli library](http://radcli.github.io/radcli/)
is required. The minimum requirement is version 1.2.0. Alternatively
the freeradius-client library can be used (1.1.7 is the minimum
requirement), but not all radius features may be available.

radcli uses a configuration file to setup the
server configuration. That is typically found at:
/etc/radcli/radiusclient.conf
and is best to copy the default installed as radiusclient-ocserv.conf
and edit it accordingly.

The important options for ocserv usage are the following:
```
dictionary 	/etc/radcli/dictionary
servers         /etc/radcli/servers
```

The dictionary should contain at least the attributes shown below,
and the servers file should contain the radius server to use.

Note, that ocserv provides the 'NAS-Port' attribute to server,
which corresponds to the worker process PID value. This PID value
may change during accounting (because the client may be handled
by a different process/port). To make the port change, not affect
the radius server's unique ID, you must configure the server
not to account NAS-Port. In freeradius servers for example you
have to remove the NAS-Port attribute from the acct_unique section.


Ocserv configuration
====================

For authentication the following line should be enabled.
```
auth = "radius[config=/etc/radcli/radiusclient.conf,groupconfig=true]"
```

Check the ocserv manpage for the meaning of the various options
such as groupconfig.

To enable accounting, use
```
acct = "radius[config=/etc/radcli/radiusclient.conf]"
```

and modify the following option to the time (in
seconds), that accounting information should be reported.
```
stats-report-time = 360
```

That value will be overridden by Acct-Interim-Interval if sent
by the server.
